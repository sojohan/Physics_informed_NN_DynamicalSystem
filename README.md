This github page is the repository for my project on Physics informed Neural Networks for 
Dynamical systems. In the folder 'Data Driven Solution' Is the code for the Heat and Burges equations, in the folder 'Data Driven Discovery' the code to estimate the parameters.  In the bottom of the file of Heat_equation in the Data Driven Solution folder I have added the code for the examples regarding the pytorch functions vjp and jvp.
